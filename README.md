The application is developed with Flutter framework, and firebase databases in real time to the application. When the user opens the application, the program directs the user to the home page, which contains medicine data in the form of cards, each card represents the jars in which the medicine  will be placed.When pressing the card, if there is no prior medication, the user will be directed to enter the medication through a pop-up window from the bottom. This window contains a button that reads the barcode of the medicine. When reading the barcode, the jars are opened automatically, and upon completion of data filling, such as the number of pills and the time required to take the medicine, the jars are closed when the add button is pressed. If there is a medicine, the user is directed to a window that contains buttons that modify the values ​​​​in the database, such as opening the jars, hanging them, or permanently deleting the medicine information.
